'''
A colony of Aucks (super-intelligent alien bioengineers) has landed on Earth and has created new species of farm animals! 
The Aucks are performing their experiments on Earth, and plan on transporting the mutant animals back to their home planet of Aurock. 
In this problem set, you will implement algorithms to figure out how the aliens should shuttle their experimental animals back across space.
